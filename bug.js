This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that points to an image that doesn't exist or is inaccessible.  The `Image` component might not handle this gracefully, resulting in a silent failure or a blank space where the image should be.  Debugging this can be challenging because there isn't a clear error message in the console.  The image URI needs to be carefully checked for correctness.  Additionally, network connectivity and CORS issues may also be responsible.
